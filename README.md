# Data-Driven Course Demand Prediction and Resource Planning System  
Vijaybhoomi University

# Project Overview
This project predicts student demand for university courses using synthetic data and traditional machine learning models. The goal is to help academic planners make better decisions about faculty allocation, classroom capacity, and course offerings.

# Problem Statement
Universities often face challenges in estimating course demand accurately. Poor planning can lead to overcrowded classes or underutilized resources. This system provides a data-driven solution to forecast enrollment.

# Features
- Synthetic data generation for course demand
- Data preprocessing and analysis
- Training multiple ML models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Ready pipeline for making predictions
- Designed for dashboard integration (Google Colab / Streamlit)

# Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab
